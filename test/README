There are two programs in the folder.
sort.java
Basic.java

If the data is already sorted, you can directly run the Basic.java to get the answer.
If not you need to run the sort.java to get the sorted data then run the Basic.java.

-sort.java
Change [toBeSorted] to your data file path and give the output file a name by changing [sort_output].

-Basic.java
[input_file] is your data file path and [ground_truth] should be the list of bad plates.
[RecordWindow] means the number of searching records back when finding an abnormal record.
[DistanceWindow](km) means the maximum distance of searching records back when finding an abnormal record.
[CountLimit] is the noise filter parameter, it means how many records you can tolerate in distance window.
[SpeedLimit](km/s) means the maximum speed allowed, if the speed between two records is over this value then the detector will work.
[DistanceLimit](km/s) means the maximum distance allowed, if the distance between two records is over this value then the detector will work.

You can change the parameters to find a best combination. Notice that if you set CountLimit = 0 then the noise filter is closed.
The parameter of function [run] is used to batch running the program when testing different parameters.
Run the program and it will output the recall, precision and F1score.

The output file will be guilty.txt. It lists the bad plates detected and their probablitily.
